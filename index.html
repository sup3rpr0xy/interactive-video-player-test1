          00:00:07,535 --> 00:00:11,270
          Well there are many ways to
          connect to the internet, and

          4
          00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,960
          most often people connect wirelessly.

          5
          00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,940
          Let's look at an example of how
          you can connect to the internet.

          6
          00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,370
          If you live in a city or a town,
          you probably have a coaxial cable for

          7
          00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,880
          cable Internet, or a phone line if you
          have DSL, running to the outside of

          8
          00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,920
          your house, that connects you to
          the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.

          9
          00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,730
          If you live far out in the country,
          you'll more likely have

          10
          00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,430
          a dish outside your house, connecting
          you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or

          11
          00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,190
          you might also use the telephone system.

          12
          00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,300
          Whether a wire comes straight from
          the ISP hookup outside your house, or

          13
          00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,270
          it travels over radio
          waves from your roof,

          14
          00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,760
          the first stop a wire will make once
          inside your house, is at your modem.

          15
          00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,780
          A modem is what connects the internet
          to your network at home.

          16
          00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,150
          A few common residential modems are DSL or
